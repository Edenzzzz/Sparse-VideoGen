Before the ancient and mysterious temple, a benevolent dragon slowly circles, its golden scales shimmering as if carrying thousands of years of wisdom and power. At the moment of transition, a snake leaps up gracefully, its agile form streaking across the sky, intertwining with the dragon's figure, symbolizing the cycle of life and endless hope. The first light of New Year's Day appears, and a colorful, brilliant glow fills the dome, as gorgeous as a fairyland. The camera slowly zooms in, capturing this dreamlike moment, where light and shadow interweave, and the ancient and modern, the mysterious and hopeful, perfectly merge, displaying a unique and stunning aesthetic.
