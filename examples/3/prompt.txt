A camera slowly zooms in from a distance, revealing a fair-skinned Eastern beauty standing in a misty, rainy Jiangnan-style courtyard. She is wearing a light cyan dress with woven gold cloud patterns, its hem gently swaying in the breeze. Her ink-black hair is half-tied up in an elegant bun with a pearl jade hairpin, with a few strands fluttering in the wind. Her slender fingers gently caress the wisteria flowers under the eaves, her eyes are gentle and full of affection, and her face resembles a beauty from a traditional Gongbi painting. In the courtyard, water trickles from a rockery, and ancient blue flagstones are scattered with wisteria petals, while distant pink walls, dark tiles, and bamboo shadows intertwine. Natural light diffuses through the thin mist, outlining the perfect profile of the woman. The camera slowly circles at a 45-degree upward angle, capturing her exquisitely pure and elegant temperament. The ultra-realistic texture, cinematic atmosphere, and transition from a medium shot to a close-up create a sense of Eastern aesthetics.
